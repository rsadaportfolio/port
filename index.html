					In September 2017, Elayhu, one of the more promising music acts of the new-age, asked me to be his personal manager after he just received a message from Capitol Records to discuss a potential label deal. Instead of accepting the position immediately, I told him to allow me to prove myself and my abilities to avoid rushing into this role presumptuously. This business plan was devised in the early stages of my management career, and the ultimate goal was to help my friend with his career trajectory once he decided to move down to Los Angeles and pursue music full-time.

						In posting this document, I hope to show that I am fully capable of long-term strategy and action-analysis in any given situation.

                        When I interned at Label Engine (a distribution company acquired by Create Music Group) my coordinators approached me with the task of promoting the company's twitter page. From this experience, I learned the value of grassroots engagement with a desired audience. I contacted and communicated with potential consumers - hoping to convert them to our platform. I manually targeted music artists, labels, professionals, and companies in our industry in our niche on Twitter. I crafted short quips of praise towards them, and achieved significant results. 

​

                       These results show my grasp for building a following on social media through marketing a platform that supports its consumers wholeheartedly.

					In February 2016, I joined the online music blog Hiddenprophets as a writer. By the end of the year, the creator told me he wanted me to run the operation, and become the Director and Site Administrator. As part of my diligence towards promoting our blog's content, I spent days scouring the web for methods and channels to push our blog above the rest of our competitors. I recorded my research in this document, as a synthesis of numerous resources. With this document, I hope to show my unyielding curiosity for unearthing procedural tactics, and my determination to adequately research and integrate content from across the web.

					Any web source must be optimized for search engines in order to remain relevant. I knew that adamantly researching SEO would allow Hiddenprophets to reach its full potential, as opposed to fading into obscurity. As part of my SEO research, I became Lynda.com SEO certified, and also studied the advice from SEO forums and backlink blogs. In this guide, I hope to show my technical understanding of the concept of SEO. Though the topic may seem difficult to tackle and understand, I believe that a basic grasp on these topics will allow for peak visibility and boost long-term growth and traffic.

				During my time with Hiddenprophets, I organized a team of over 20 bloggers based in Los Angeles, Davis, Fremont, and Michigan. To run a successful operation, we needed each person to utilize their own social networks to promote our blog's content. In this document, I created a step-by-step process for each person to  take action across multiple social platforms.I aim for this document to reflect my ability to concretely divide processes into separate parts, and how they combine to reflect an overarching goal of publicity and self-advertising.

                        My outlet for expression has always resided in written form. When I joined the music management company Plugged Digital, my task was to express the essence of each release from our artist WurlD. I intended to articulate the message and thematic elements present in WurlD's music, and describe each musical element and lyric as distinctly unique. This document demonstrates my ability to represent a cause beneficially and effectively raise awareness for an audience .

                         In this speech, I dived deeper into the fundamental meaning of Partynextdoor's song "TBH." Though it may seem like a trivial and shallow song on the surface, I wrote on the underlying implications and further analysis I found relevant in the song.This speech exemplifies my ability to translate context and establish a broader connection for any piece of art or professional work.

                      After my sophomore year at UCLA, I decided to apply for the Communications major at the school. Although I was rejected, the application essay questions forced me to examine the memorable details in my life that constituted my unique character and psyche. This piece exhibits my pride for my own character, and my mission to encourage diversity and defying society's standards of "normalcy."
